# 🎮 GUI Number Guessing Game

Welcome to my **first ever GUI-based project**!  
This is a simple Number Guessing Game built with **Python** using **Tkinter** and following **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

## 🚀 About the Project

This game is my first step into the world of graphical user interfaces (GUI) using Python.  
I’ve always built CLI apps, but now I'm leveling up by learning how to make interactive applications that look and feel more user-friendly.

> The main goal of this project was to practice:
>
> - Building a GUI with Tkinter
> - Applying OOP concepts in Python
> - Handling user input and basic game logic
